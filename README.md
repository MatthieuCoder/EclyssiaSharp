## Ratelimit note. âš¡

Byt default the api is restricted at 1 request per second. This library handles the ratelimit automaticly, so you don't have to worry about it but the method calls can take up to 1 second.

## There is two ways of using the library.

### The static way.

You can use all the public methods on the `StaticClient.cs` class.
All the sync methods returns a `Stream` ( Wich contains the requestested image bytes )
All the async methods returns a `Task<Stream>` ( Wich contains the requestested image bytes )

### The implemented client.

**The implemented client only calls the static methods âš **

You can get an implemented client from the static client with the `GetImplementedClient()` method.
